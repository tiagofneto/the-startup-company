# The Startup Company

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started
1. Run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up
```
2. Wait for all containers to start. The process is complete when you see the Next.js startup information in the console for the `startup-company-monorepo-frontend-1` container (this typically takes around 1 minute).
3. Once the frontend container displays the Next.js startup information, you can access the application at `localhost:8000`
